# Face-recognition
Face recognition using OpenCv
Here I have used [harcascade files](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) to make a face recognition model
> OpenCV provides a training method (see Cascade Classifier Training) or pretrained models, that can be read using the cv::CascadeClassifier::load method. The pretrained models are located in the data folder in the OpenCV installation or can be found here.

## Haarcascade file used are:
```
  haarcascade_frontalFace_alt2.xml
  haarcascade_eye.xml
  haarcascade_smile.xml
```
# Description
* <b>Getting DataSet</b><br>
  Images are taken and stored in the data folder in my file system from where the data would be trained.
  The images should  be:
  - appropriate size
  - In all lighting conditions
  - Front facing
  <br>
  Here while getting images if the user we need approx 30-40 images per person to get a nearly accuate result. So to over come the problem of taking 30-40 pictures from the camera app and storing every image with same name onto my data folder, I made an <b>Automated Program</b> that takes around selfies with a click of a button.
> Even while clicking pictures automatically the eyes were sometimes closed so my program couldn't get accurate data. So to resolve this issue I used **Eye haarcascade** to detect if a persons' eye was closed so pictures will not be taken at that moment.
* <b>Training Model</b><br>
  The model encodes every image and stored the encoding file. 
  <i>It takes approx 5 minutes to train a set of 200-300 images.</i>
* <b>Execution</b><br>
  The model executes itself with realtime webcam as a source. The laptop's/computer's inbuilt webcam is used for this operation. The video input is taken as frames and the individual images are converted to greyscale and then comapared by our trained model
  The model shows the individual's name and percentage of the user being that person.
* <b>Extra</b><br>
  The model was then modified and used for attendence project. The model takes a list and stores every person that has been verified by the program to mark it present.
  And when the program is stopped the resulting attendence of all the attendies whose data is present is shown.
### The project was over all fun and I learned a lot about open cv. The project have so much scope for an upgrade with latest technology.
